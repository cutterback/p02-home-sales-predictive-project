# Flatiron Phase 2 Project - Seattle Home Price Predictive Linear Regression Model

## Business Problem
A local real estate agency named Seattle Realco specializes in helping buyers buy and setters navigate the Seattle residential home market. Seattle Realco has contracted with me on a project to build a phase 1 predictive model that meets the following business requireents:

- Find the best initial prediction model for Seattle area home prices
- Model performance should do significantly better than using "averages"
- The predictor inputs into the model should be commonly available for new home buyers/sellers
- Deliverables should explain the relative influence that each predictor has on the overall model predictions

Seattle Realco intends for their agents to use this model when working with buyers and sellers to ballpark the expected sales price on homes of interest.

## Project Deliverable
The project involved analyzing, cleansing, plotting, featurizing and modeling about a year's worth (20K) home sales in the Seattle metro-area from 2014-20125. I used the tools and libraries from Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, StatsModel, Sklearn and Scipy. We had a requirement to develop a multiple linear regression model as an initial approach to forecasting home prices. Here you can find my [final business presentation][1] and my [Jupyter notebook][2].
